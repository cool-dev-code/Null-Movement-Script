## What is this?
This is a script of (AHK) Auto Hotkey Software
## What is it for?
To make your Right Left movement faster in PC games.
## Description:
This script updates the A and D keys so that only one is held down at a time
This avoids the situation where game engines treat holding both strafe keys as not moving
Instead, holding both strafe keys will cause you to move in the direction of the last one that was pressed
The same logic is applied to the W and S keys (only one can be held at a time)
## Requirements
- Install [AutoHotkey 2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
## Is it Cheating?
No but also yes, As you have unfair advantage over other players.
## Can i get banned for using this?
Yes, In some known games like Faceit, Counter Strike 2 (CS2), Minecraft Premium Servers (Hypixel etc.) and further research on your own .. Google it yourself.
## Fun Fact
Razor Snap-tap feature works same as this script.
